      <p>
        Green tea is a type of tea that is made from Camellia sinensis leaves
        and buds that have not undergone the same withering and oxidation 
        process which is used to make oolong teas and black teas.
        Green tea originated in China, and since then its production and 
        manufacture has spread to other countries in East Asia.
        Several varieties of green tea exist, which differ substantially 
        based on the variety of C. sinensis used, growing conditions, 
        horticultural methods, production processing, and time of harvest.
